## Intro  
&nbsp;  
<p3>So we have created an app. It works and has all the components you need..but it still looks a bit...</p3>

<p2>So what do we do??</p2>  

<p>Fortunately we have several options available in Shiny that can change the appear ance of your app. For example: 
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Shiny Themes</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

Today we're only going to cover the first two options.</p>

## HTML/CSS  
&nbsp;  
<p>The following section aims to show you how HTML and CSS are used in Shiny and how you can use it without having to become a full-blown website developer.<p>

&nbsp; 

<p>The following RStudio site describes the use of the HTML tags quite well. So if you want to use the tags in your app today, [please check it out](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html).</p>

<br><br>
<p2>CSS</p2>
<br>
<p>You can add custom CSS to your app by creating a www/ subdirectory to your app and adding a CSS file there. Suppose, for example, you want to change the title font of your dashboard to the same font as the rest of the dashboard, so that it looks like this:</p>
<center>
![](css_header_ex.png)
</center><br>
<p>To do this, first create a file named www/custom.css with the following:</p>
```{css eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
.main-header .logo {
  font-family: "Georgia", Times, "Times New Roman", serif;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<p>Then refer to that CSS file from the UI of your app:</p>
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
## ui.R ##
dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Custom font"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody(
    tags$head(
      tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", type = "text/css", href = "custom.css")
    )
  )
)
```

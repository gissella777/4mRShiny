# Overview

Interested in turning your analysis in to sleek, production ready interactive dashboards? This day long workshop will introduce the basics of using R Shiny, the industry standard R Reporting tool, to create your own hosted web applications. By the end of the session you’ll have built your very own fully interactive app in R to simplify a real business problem.

**Requirements:** A good level of knowledge of R is required to participate. If you’re unsure about your experience, contact Gissella or Nir. **To attend you must also ensure, you've completed all the Pre-reqs.**

# Structure

We start with understanding what Shiny is and why we're learning to use it today.

#### After the intro, this workshop is split into 3 key sections:  
  - Core Shiny 1 - The Shiny structure and building your first app  
  - Core Shiny 2 - Customisation and going beyond the default Shiny appearance  
  - Core Shiny 3 - Debugging and deploying your app into the real world

# Projects

The Pre-Requisites section contains 3 datasets to use as a basis for an R Shiny App. You can build an app with most data but we're restricting today to these three for ease.

#### Current Datasets:
  - Predicting Poverty in Costa Rica
  - AirBnb & Berlin
  - Speed-Dating

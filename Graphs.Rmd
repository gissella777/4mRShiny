&nbsp;    
<p>As mentioned earlier, the choice of graph is important. You needs to balance the requirement to inform verus overwhelming your end user with information. As a rule of thumb...</p>

## Resources  
&nbsp;      
<p>Given the number of options out there, I've scoured the internet far and wide for a useful resource. The following site ([Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html))not only assists you in choosing the right sort of graph but also provides you with examples and R code that can be used to create your chosen graph! For those who are interested, the site also provides Python examples.</p>

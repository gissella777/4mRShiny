```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If we're incredibly lucky, everything works the first time and we have no errors. If so, we can dance...

But let's get back to reality because the sad truth is that you will experience errors that will make you crazy! With this in mind, this section will address debugging.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
